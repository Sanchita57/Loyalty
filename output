The issue you're encountering is related to **authentication failure**. Specifically, the response from the server is `HTTP/1.1 401`, which indicates **unauthorized access**. This means the credentials you are providing to `curl` are either incorrect or not being passed properly.

### Key points in the output:
1. **Authentication problem**: The message "Authentication problem. Ignoring this." means that the credentials passed are invalid.
2. **Authorization Header**: `Authorization: Basic aDpzdmNhY2N0LWxveWFsdHlidWlsZA==` shows that the base64-encoded credentials are sent. However, they seem to be incorrect.

### Steps to troubleshoot and fix:

#### 1. **Check Credentials (`CREDS`)**
   - The script is using `Basic authentication` where the credentials are encoded into the `Authorization` header (`aDpzdmNhY2N0LWxveWFsdHlidWlsZA==`).
   - Decode this base64 string to see what credentials are being sent. You can decode it using the following command in your terminal:
     ```bash
     echo "aDpzdmNhY2N0LWxveWFsdHlidWlsZA==" | base64 --decode
     ```
     Ensure that the decoded value matches the correct `username:password`. If not, update the credentials either in your script or environment variables.

#### 2. **Ensure Correct Proxy Settings**
   - You are connecting through a proxy (`Connection #0 to host proxy.prod.local left intact`), so ensure that the proxy settings (`proxy`) are correct and accessible.

#### 3. **Verify Artifactory Credentials**
   - If you're using `CREDS` for authentication (which should be the format `username:
